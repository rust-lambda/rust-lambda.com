question: "I'm new to software engineering. Is this book suitable for me?"

Absolutely! This book is crafted to be beginner-friendly, making it a great
choice for those just starting in tech or transitioning from other fields. A
basic understanding of Rust and AWS will be helpful, but beyond that, all you
need is curiosity and a willingness to learn. The opening chapters gently
introduce Lambda functions and serverless computing, designed to be easy to
follow for readers from diverse backgrounds. We begin each topic (e.g.
databases, testing, and specific cloud services) with a high-level overview
before diving into the details of AWS Lambda and Rust.
