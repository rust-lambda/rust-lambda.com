question: "Do I need to be an expert in Rust to enjoy this book?"

No. While a basic understanding of Rust syntax is helpful, this book is beginner-friendly. If you are new to Rust, reading the [official Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) first might be beneficial. The book explains advanced Rust concepts as they are used in the context of AWS Lambda.
