No. This book assumes only a basic familiarity with AWS. You should have an AWS account and have the AWS CLI installed and configured on your development machine. The book covers all necessary AWS serverless concepts and services, including DynamoDB, API Gateway, EventBridge, CloudWatch, SAM, and more in a way that is suitable to AWS beginners. Even if you have never used these services and tools, you should be able to follow along and understand the concepts as you progress through the book.
