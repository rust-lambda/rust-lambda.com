**A Game-Changer for Serverless with Rust – Can’t Wait for More!**

This book has been such an inspiration for me. After starting this book, I've
moved away from writing all my Lambda functions in Python and JavaScript to
Rust. James and Luciano have done a great job explaining all the intricacies of
building Serverless applications with Rust. Even though I got in on the book
during the Alpha period, I've gotten a lot! Can't wait for the rest of the book
to be finished!
