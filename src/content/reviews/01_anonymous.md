I'm guilty of not having used Rust anywhere serious yet, so my knowledge is
close to zero. Nevertheless, I was still able to follow because Luciano and
James do a fantastic job of explaining. You'll learn why Rust is a great fit for
serverless applications, and they cover everything from setting up your
environment to optimizing for performance and cost. If you're looking to expand
your skills in serverless architecture and want to see why Rust is maybe the way
to go, this book is definitely worth checking out!
